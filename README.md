# Overview
- In this analysis we are looking at we are digging deeper into the temperture data for months of June and December in Oahu, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round
# Results
- December is only 3 degrees lower than June
- December deviation is .5 higher June casusing higher variablity for temperatures.
- The min in June was only 64 degrees (!!) compared to 56 in December 
# Summary
- Overall the weather for surfing looks great all year round minus some lost days in December. Knowing the temp at which people will not surf at a significant rate would be helpful to find how many days we can expect to lose within the two months.
